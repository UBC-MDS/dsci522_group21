    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents an analysis of the factors influencing client subscriptions to term deposits at a Portuguese banking institution. Utilizing a dataset comprising 45,211 client interactions with a target variable and 16 input features, we apply logistic regression and decision tree classifiers to identify the top three predictors of term deposit subscriptions. The data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical variables. Our exploratory data analysis leverages visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations, while model evaluation focuses on precision and recall due to the dataset's imbalance. Logistic regression is likely to prove slightly superior in precision to the decision tree classifier. The analysis identifies the outcome of previous campaigns, the month of contact, and the call duration as the most significant predictors. These findings offer valuable insights into the decision-making process of clients regarding term deposit subscriptions and suggest areas for future research."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evolving world of banking and finance, the ability to understand and predict customer behavior is key to developing successful marketing strategies. Term deposits, a core financial product, serve a dual purpose: they provide a safe investment option for customers and a reliable source of funding for banks. For financial institutions looking to grow their customer base and ensure financial stability, it's crucial to understand what drives customers to invest in these term deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study focuses on uncovering the factors that influence a customer's decision to subscribe to a term deposit at a Portuguese banking institution. We pose a critical question: What are the top three factors that determine whether a client will invest in a term deposit at this bank? To explore this, we analyze a dataset that contains over 45,000 individual client records, including demographic data and details of interactions from the bank's term deposit marketing campaigns. With consideration of a logistic regression model and decision tree classifier, renowned for their efficacy in handling both numeric and categorical variables, we aim to detect significant patterns from this dataset. Our objective is to provide insights that could lead to an improvement to the effectiveness of marketing strategies that boost term deposit subscriptions at the institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of this research lies in its potential to transform marketing strategies for the banking institution. By accurately understanding and predicting customer behavior, our findings can guide the Portuguese financial institution in crafting more effective and tailored marketing approaches. This not only aids in customer acquisition and retention but also ensures that customers are presented with options that align with their financial goals and needs. In an era where personalized services are becoming the norm, such insights are invaluable for banks seeking to remain competitive and foster long-term customer relationships.\n"

    "## Data\n",
    "The data set utilized in this project was created by SÃ©rgio Moro, P. Cortez, and P. Rita, and is hosted on the UCI Machine Learning Repository {cite}`Moro2012`. It can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). The data was sourced from the marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, focusing on client subscriptions to term deposits. The primary dataset, `bank-full.csv`, includes 45,211 examples with 17 variables. Each row in the dataset represents information from a client contact during the campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comprehensively covers client demographic information (such as age, job type, marital status, and education level), financial information (including credit default history, average yearly balance, housing and personal loan status), and information about bank marketing (like the type of contact, date of the last contact, call duration, number of contacts in the current campaign, days elapsed since the last contact in a previous campaign, outcome of the previous campaigns, and finally, whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit).\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "Logistic regression and decision tree classifier were considered to develop a model for determining the top 3 factors that aid in predicting if a client will subscribe to a term deposit. To be able to explore the significance of each attribute, all variables included in the original data set were used to fit the model. The exploratory section of our data analysis explored the distribution of categorical and numerical variables, and correlation between the numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preprocessing phase, categorical or binary variables were transformed using one-hot encoding, ordered categorical variable was ordinal encoded, and numerical variables were standardized. The data was then split, assigning 75% to the training set and 25% to the test set. The evaluation of both logistic regression and decision tree classifier was conducted with a detailed focus on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, prioritizing precision in particular. This emphasis on precision is crucial for our study, which aims to minimize Type 1 errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Language {cite}`VanRossum2009` and its libraries, including pandas {cite}`Mckinney2010`, NumPy {cite}`Harris2020`, scikit-learn {cite}`Pedregosa2011`, and Altair {cite}`VanderPlas2018`, were essential for the analysis. The environment file used to run the analysis was adapted from the University of British Columbia DSCI 573 Feature and Model Selection course repository {cite}`Ostblom2023`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed that logistic regression exhibited slightly better precision than the decision tree classifier, with a smaller gap between training and testing scores, suggesting better generalizability. Logistic regression was also highly regarded as the model for assessing feature importance, given its strong interpretability. Upon model fitting and evaluation, the top three features predicting a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit were identified by sorting feature importance in terms of absolute coefficient. \n",

We assessed these models using five-fold cross-validation based on key metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall. This approach was particularly vital in examining the impact of our dataset's unbalanced nature on the likelihood of errors. Our analysis places a higher emphasis on precision. This is because our objective is to identify true positives with minimal false positives, in the context of examining client subscriptions to term deposits at the Portuguese banking institution. By centering our analysis on precision, we aim to ensure that the features under consideration are truly indicative of successful term deposit subscriptions, thus providing more reliable insights into client behavior."

Additionally, the Logistic Regression model demonstrates a narrower disparity between training and testing scores, suggesting a higher potential of effective generalization. Despite these findings, there remains potential for precision improvement. In future efforts to predict subscription outcomes, increasing the threshold could improve precision.

    "The analysis reveals that `poutcome`, `month`, and `duration` are the three most significant features influencing a client's likelihood to subscribe to a term deposit. Clients with a previous successful `poutcome` tend to be more inclined to subscribe, likely due to their positive experiences with the bank's services. Interestingly, `month` contains a pattern where in March (\"mar\") there is a higher subscription rate and in January (\"jan\") the rate is lower. This finding could suggest a seasonal factor, possibly linked to financial periods, though its exact cause remains unclear and would require further external research. Longer `duration` of calls is linked with increased subscription rates, potentially implying greater client interest and giving salespersons more time for effective pitching might add to the likelihood of subscription."

    "Our Logistic Regression model displayed some predictive performance for client subscriptions to term deposits, as shown by consistent precision test, validation, and train scores. Nonetheless, it's important to consider these results while acknowledging our limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first limitation refers to our dataset displaying a significant imbalance in the target distribution (88.2358% 'no' subscription rate versus 11.7642% 'yes' rate). Despite our efforts to compensate for the imbalance by including the use of precision and recall metrics, the imbalance could still impact the overall generalizability of our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation stems from our interpretation of the potential seasonal trend, sourced from the significance of January and March months in subscription rates. We initially linked these insights to the potential fiscal calendar of the Portuguese banking institutions, thinking financial tax or bonus periods could influence client receptiveness. This idea came from our team's knowledge that not all countries follow the same financial quarters. However, this theory was no longer considered after we discovered that the financial year for Portugal ends in December. This points to the possibility of other unknown external factors influencing the `month` feature, which are beyond the scope of our dataset. Understanding the reasons behind the potential seasonality trend and incorporating additional data could generate more insightful observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our decision to opt for the Logistic Regression model over the Decision Tree Classifier was justified by a very minimal difference in test precision (1%). This decision was guided by the ease in interpretability of feature importance that Logistic Regression models offer, which might have led us to overlook the potential insights Decision Tree models offer. Thus, the top three features the Decision Tree Classifier selected are worth looking into too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time constraints also impacted our analysis. This limitation might have restricted the depth of our analysis, potentially overlooking more sophisticated modeling approaches that could further improve our understanding of client subscriptions to term deposits at the Portuguese banking institution. Future improvements could involve exploring more complex models like Random Forests and adjusting the threshold to enhance precision."
