    "\n",
    "This report presents an analysis of the factors influencing client subscriptions to term deposits at a Portuguese banking institution. Utilizing a dataset comprising 45,211 client interactions with 17 input features, we apply logistic regression and decision tree classifiers to identify the top three predictors of term deposit subscriptions. The data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical variables. Our exploratory data analysis leverages visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations, while model evaluation focuses on precision and recall due to the dataset's imbalance. Logistic regression is likely to prove slightly superior in precision to the decision tree classifier. The analysis identifies the outcome of previous campaigns, the month of contact, and the call duration as the most significant predictors. These findings offer valuable insights into the decision-making process of clients regarding term deposit subscriptions and suggest areas for future research."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In an age where banking and finance are rapidly transforming, the ability to analyze and predict customer behavior has become indispensable for crafting impactful marketing strategies. Term deposits, a staple financial product, offer customers a secure investment option, while providing banks with a stable funding source. Understanding what motivates a customer to commit to these term deposits is of particular interest to financial institutions seeking to bolster their customer base and secure funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation centers on identifying the key determinants that influence a customer's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. We pose the following question: What are the primary factors that predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit at a banking institution? To address this question, we will leverage a comprehensive dataset `bank-full.csv` provided by a Portuguese bank along with a few sub datasets inlcuding `bank.csv` a 10% subset of the `bank-full.csv`, `bank-additional-full.csv` is a newer version from May 2008 to November 2010, `bank-addtional.csv` is a 10% subset of `bank-addtional-full.csv`, `bank-name.txt`, and `bank-addtional-names.txt`, which detail the outcomes of their marketing campaigns related to term deposits. This dataset includes a range of variables from client demographic information to details of contact during the campaigns, encompassing over 45,000 individual client records.\n",
    "\n",
    "To uncover the patterns within this data, we will employ two widely recognized machine learning models: logistic regression and decision tree classifiers. These models are chosen for their ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, providing a robust framework for our analysis. Through this methodical and data-driven investigation, we aim to offer reliable and actionable insights that could significantly enhance the efficiency of marketing strategies tailored towards increasing term deposit subscriptions. Furthermore, We will also be seeing a significant challenge which is the class imbalance within the dataset. This imbalance can skew predictive modeling, leading to overfitting and reduced model performance on unseen data. Addressing this, we will techniques tailored to balance the dataset, thus ensuring that our models provide an accurate reflection of the underlying patterns."

    "## Analysis\n",
    "Logistic regression and decision tree classifiers were employed to develop a model for determining the top 3 factors that aid in predicting if a client will subscribe to a term deposit. All variables included in the original data set, with the exception of `contact` and `poutcome`, which contained too many unknown examples, were used to fit the model. The exploratory data analysis focused on understanding variable distributions and relationships between features. It employed visualizations like bar charts and histograms for categorical and numerical variables. Correlation heatmaps were generated to assess the relationships among numerical features and to detect potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preprocessing phase, categorical or binary variables were transformed using one-hot encoding, ordered variables were ordinal encoded, and numerical variables were standardized. The data was then split, assigning 75% to the training set and 25% to the test set. The logistic regression model aimed to look into the relationship between the predictors and the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit. Similarly, the decision tree classifier was employed to identify the decision making framework that leads to subscriptions based on the features. Both models were thoroughly evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Language (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009) and its libraries, including pandas (McKinney, 2010), NumPy (Harris et al., 2020), scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), and Altair (VanderPlas, 2018), were essential for the analysis. The complete code and methodology are documented in [https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci522_group21/blob/main/src/term_deposit_full_analysis.ipynb].\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed that Logistic Regression exhibited slightly better precision than the decision tree classifier, with a smaller gap between training and testing scores, suggesting better generalizability. Upon model fitting and evaluation, the top three features predicting a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit were identified by sorting feature (coefficient) importance.\n"

    "During our analysis, it was noted that the dataset exhibits an imbalance in class proportions within the target. Additionally, the features `job`, `education`, `contact`, and `poutcome` include \"unknown\" entries distinct from null values. Due to insufficient dataset information, proper imputation of these unknown values is not feasible. Specifically, the `contact` and `poutcome` columns, containing excessive unknown values, required removal. Eliminating only the unknown values from these columns was deemed impractical as it would significantly reduce the data. On the other hand, the `job` and `education` features, despite also containing unknown values, were manageable and were retained by simply removing the unknown entries."

    "The analysis reveals that `poutcome`, `month`, and `duration` are the three most significant features influencing a client's likelihood to subscribe to a term deposit. Clients with a previous successful `poutcome` tend to be more inclined to subscribe, likely due to their positive experiences with the bank's services. Interestingly, `month` contains a pattern where in March (\"mar\") there is a higher subscription rate and in January (\"jan\") the rate is lower. This finding could suggest a seasonal factor, possibly linked to financial periods, though its exact cause remains unclear and would require further external research. Longer `duration` of calls is linked with increased subscription rates, potentially implying greater client interest and giving salespersons more time for effective pitching might add to the likelihood of subscription."

    "Our Logistic Regression model showed promising results in predicting client subscriptions to term deposits. Future improvements could involve exploring more complex models like Random Forests and adjusting the threshold to enhance precision. Understanding the reasons behind the potential seasonality trend and incorporating additional data could also yield more insightful observations. Moreover, given that during model comparison the difference in scores where minimal, the top three features selected by the Decision Tree Classifier are worth looking into."
